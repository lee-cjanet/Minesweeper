# Minesweeper

# Background

Minesweeper is a game of both chance and logic. The player begins by clicking any square marks on the board. The board will review a number or a denotated bomb. If the square reveals a number, that number tells you how many bombs are in the adjacent squares. If the square reveals a bomb, all the bombs on the board will be denotated, rendering the game over. The player can also choose to place an exclamation point or a question mark on the board's sqaures. An exclamation point indicates that a bomb in the marked square while a question represents a possibility of a bomb in that square. To win, the player has to identify all the bombs on board by clicking all the possible squares without clicking any bombs.
